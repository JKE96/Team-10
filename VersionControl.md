#Version Control#
##In The Animal Kingdom##
Charles Darwin was one of the greatest documenters of version control that biologists have ever seen. Understanding and documenting animals evolve over time and being one of the first to document changes between species is one of the most popular examples of documenting version control. There are finite reasons – for the most part – why animals evolve the way they do, such as switching bipedal in order to run farther, and in the case of the flying squirrel, growing loose skin helps it glide from tree to tree. Plants have also evolved over time, from being able to take in more or less water, to changes in size, plants also evolve for ensuing survival.
