#Version Control#
##Keeping Track of Things##
###In The Animal Kingdom###
Charles Darwin was one of the greatest documenters of version control that biologists have ever seen. Understanding and documenting animals evolve over time and being one of the first to document changes between species is one of the most popular examples of documenting version control. There are finite reasons – for the most part – why animals evolve the way they do, such as switching bipedal in order to run farther, and in the case of the flying squirrel, growing loose skin helps it glide from tree to tree. Plants have also evolved over time, from being able to take in more or less water, to changes in size, plants also evolve for ensuing survival.

###Banks###
Banks need to have a version control system, as they deal with our money on a daily basis, and who has how much money. We all would not be happy if our banks could not determine how much cash we have in our accounts and how many accounts we have. Bank ledgers handle the transaction history, let the bank and user know how much money the users have, and when each transaction was made. Banks can measure a person’s wealth dependent on the time the money changes hands. Ledgers also help users claim fraud, as the user can say “No, I was not in Anchorage, AL this morning and then traveled back to Bloomington, IN two hours later.” This helps the user know when and where charges were charged to them, and with more and more digital records, this is done in nearly real-time.

###Hospitals###
Health Care is one of the most sued industries in the current market. Health Care professionals need version control, seemingly more than anyone else, in order to know to blame. Did someone err in the medication dosage, did someone kill a patient, or did some just participate in malpractice? Malpractice cases are about who was in error, and for that, the hospitals need accurate and detailed records of what medical professional did what to which patient. This way the patient, or their legal representative, will not sue the hospital itself but sue the doctor/nurse who was in error.


##3 Pieces: Who? What? When?##
###What was changed? ###
The main purpose of a changelog, a version control variant, it to see what was changed and the previous versions of the item that were changed. This could be something as simple as previous versions of a Word Document, previous versions of a file on Box or GitHub, or something more complex like medication dosage (which cannot be reverted back). Blueprints are great examples of this in the physical world, as we can see throughout time what aspects of the structure in question were changed and when they were changed. 

###When it was changed?###
Knowing when something was changed can affect the outcome of a project. If eBay takes off even one penny from every order it processes it, the time it has taken since implementation, will affect the scale of the loss for eBay. The longer the error is in place, the more money eBay will lose. They can see when they started making less and less money and cross-examine that when changes in their financial code were made to see exactly what change caused the error. The sooner an error is found, the less of an impact the party faces.

###Who changed it?###
In order to cover our own behinds, we must associate a person to the error itself. This may be one person, or a group of induvial, but in most circumstances there is always a person to blame. Even if someone is to blamed, this not always be a bad thing, as minor errors will more than likely not result in many repercussions for the erred party. If a doctor gives a patient too much / too little of a drug, or the wrong drug altogether, the hospital needs to know which doctor was in err. This way the hospital can prepare for either a lawsuit – for malpractice – or hand down consequences for the doctor.



##Risks##
Risks come from changes that occur within a system or within a protocol that people undergo. These changes occur with anyone working on a project or manager tasks or even stakeholders. Changes of any kind have the potential to be positive or negative. No matter what change that is being implemented, big or small, it causes risky situations in terms of negative or positive potential. When attempting to implement a change, it is always good practice to keep track of everything that you change and everything that happens due to the change. Although some risks are unavoidable, keeping track of more can mitigate some risks in the long term. For example, many organizations keep many different versions of past and present policies and precedures to allow their workers to know what changes were made to previous policies. This allows the workers to know exactly what was changed, how it was changed, and how this change differs from previous policy in other versions
