##The 10 Deadly Sins of Information Security##

1. Corporate Responsibility

Every person within a corporation is given a strict responsibility to abide by the many laws and regulations that control how that organization must collect, handle, and destroy their information assets. For example, the privacy regulation under the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/), establishes a set of national standards for the protection of certain health information in order to address the use and disclosure of individuals' health information. Another example, [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. As there are increasing risks of information security breaches, there has been placed an extreme liability on corporations, hence the growing importance of risk management. 

2. Not a Technical Issue

The main concept of this deadly sin, is to avoid taking a technological perspective when looking at information security. It is important to understand that information security is a business issue and not a technical issue. Protection of information is an investment, and investment decisions are business decisions.

3. Multidimensionality
This deadly sin states that best practice involves cooperation and coordination and that only when different perspectives and different approaches are recognized can a wholesome solution be derived. Many dimensions of Information Security (IS) are not technical and integrating all of the dimensions involved early and often prevents future frustration. An example of the dimensions involved in IS is physical security which is why many organizations implement design standards for this purpose. An example at Indiana University would be the IU IDF Data Center as well as the student cards. Another example is how Lucas Oil Stadium has stairs built around it to protect visitors from errant vehicles. 

4. Identifying Risks
This deadly sin involves plans that are based off of what one thinks is a risk versus a risk that is actually verifiable. It recommends that risks be based off the probability of the event occurring and the impact it will have if it occurs. Completing risk analysis is a tedious task but one that will greatly benefit the organization in the future. Organizations implement such a practice to allocate resources properly such as money, people, etc. An example of some of the main risks facing the School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) are medical, flooding, or fire.
