##The 10 Deadly Sins of Information Security##

#1. Corporate Responsibility#

Every person within a corporation is given a strict responsibility to abide by the many laws and regulations that control how that organization must collect, handle, and destroy their information assets. For example, the privacy regulation under the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/), establishes a set of national standards for the protection of certain health information in order to address the use and disclosure of individuals' health information. Another example, [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. As there are increasing risks of information security breaches, there has been placed an extreme liability on corporations, hence the growing importance of risk management. 

#2. Not a Technical Issue#

The main concept of this deadly sin, is to avoid taking a technological perspective when looking at information security. It is important to understand that information security is a business issue and not a technical issue. Protection of information is an investment, and investment decisions are business decisions.

#3. Multidimensionality#
This deadly sin states that best practice involves cooperation and coordination and that only when different perspectives and different approaches are recognized can a wholesome solution be derived. Many dimensions of Information Security (IS) are not technical and integrating all of the dimensions involved early and often prevents future frustration. An example of the dimensions involved in IS is physical security which is why many organizations implement design standards for this purpose. An example at Indiana University would be the IU IDF Data Center as well as the student cards. Another example is how Lucas Oil Stadium has stairs built around it to protect visitors from errant vehicles. 

#4. Identifying Risks#
This deadly sin involves plans that are based off of what one thinks is a risk versus a risk that is actually verifiable. It recommends that risks be based off the probability of the event occurring and the impact it will have if it occurs. Completing risk analysis is a tedious task but one that will greatly benefit the organization in the future. Organizations implement such a practice to allocate resources properly such as money, people, etc. An example of some of the main risks facing the School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) are medical, flooding, or fire. 

#5. Best Practices #
This deadly sin is most associated with when you want to do the right things right
but you do not know what those right things are. There are generally two questions
that need to get answered when thinking about the best practices for information
security and they are 1. What are the risks that the information must be protected
from and 2. What are the best ways to provide protection from these information
risks. This is a very pressing issue because for many years business owners and
other people who want to keep there information safe have been asking these
questions. There may be no right way to do but you do need to find an effective way
to protect your information.

#6. Establish Policy#
This deadly sin is when not everybody is on the same page. Everyone in your
organization must be on the same page when it comes to rules and regulations.
Everyone needs to have the same starting point so they all can see where they are
going and how they are allowed to get there. Corporate information security policy
is essential because that is what is needed to be successful. If there is a policy, it must be enforced so people will follow it and buy-in to the rules of the company.


#7. Enforce & Monitor#
When using a security system, one must constantly monitor the usage. Audits must be in place to make sure users are being security compliant, passwords must expire in order for newer and stronger ones to be in place, and Administrators must monitor network activity to make sure it is being used efficiently. According to Basie con Solms (p. 374), “It is no use having a perfect corporate information security policy, with a comprehensive set of supporting sub-policies, conforming to international best practices, if it is not possible to monitor and enforce compliance to such policies.” Unenforced policies are not policies but only wishes, un-monitored policies are but mere guidelines. Policies need to be monitored and enforced to be strongest. 


#8. Organizational Structure #
The organizational structure of an organization must have “clear roles and responsibilities” (Paul).  If everyone in the organization has clear roles and responsibilities, then there will not be one individual person who has to maintain and be responsible for information security risks.  Also, if everyone is not held accountable for his or her actions, then a security risk arises.  This could be prevented by keeping people informed about who is responsible and in charge of certain security responsibilities. Organizational structure is not strictly based on how people are organized.  If software and individual information is not set up correctly and organized then there can be a security risk.  Without proper organization structure, people who are not allowed to have access to sensitive information can gain access.

#9. Education & Awareness#
When using a new IS, it is important to not only let people know that a new system is coming into place, but it is also important to train the users how to properly use the system – especially how to be secure on the new IS. This way you, as the administrator, cannot be held liable if a user has a colossal security screw up. It also helps prevent colossal screw ups, as the user knows what not to do and the implications if they do it. This can be done through classes, periodic quizzes, and security focused meetings. These do not have to necessarily be boring and dry, as these can have rewards for participating and doing well. Also calling out weak passwords, and other insecure means, can help the company focus more on security. 

#10. Empowerment#
If security managers cannot have the power to do their entire job, then this can create problems in the information system.  Security managers need to be able to have the correct tools to do their job, such as knowing certain security aspects of the business.  With the correct tools and information about the security infrastructure, security managers can find loopholes within an information system’s structure.  Also, having several security managers working within a team for large organizations will let security managers be able to make sure aspects of the organization system are working well for individual parts of the system and among the different areas that the security managers may be
