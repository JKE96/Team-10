#Trust#

##Personal Risks##

Trust involves giving up personal control of a situation and involves a great deal of risk between people. We trust people to present correct information but take the risk that that person is telling the truth and presenting true information. If a person gives you inaccurate information, you take the risk of paying for their actions if you pass that information along. This personal trust comes with your perceived reputation of another person, your relationship to that person, and the purpose behind you placing trust in that person. 


##Physical Risks##

Trust also involves an inherent amount of risk between ourselves an the things we interact with and/or surround us. For example, we generally trust an elevator to get us to the 16th floor of a building in a timely matter. It comes naturally to us to trust (or don't trust) the things we can see; such as the objects, environment, and people that surround us. We even seem to easily trust things that we can't see such as the internet and the digital world. We trust the internet in purchasing and ultimately delivering a physical object, such as a ticket to a concert. We also trust our credit cards, which hold our confidential financial information. The integrated chip in credit cards today, helps generate a greater belief that our credit cards keep that financial information safe and protected. 


##Loss of Trust##
Trust can be taken away at a a moments notice, and sometimes without propper cause. Loss of trust is extremely diificult to get back, as a user will always quesion the other party and always have an inkling of distrust. In 2016 Scottish Police canceelled the i6 Project, an integrated IT system worth £46 Million , because of a "loss of trust". The contractor, Accenture, reportedly breached their contract as early as October 2013 and the program was terminated in July of 2016. Accenture was forced to pay back Police Scotland £24.7 Million in refunds and settlements. This lack of trust was caused due to disagreements almost as soon as the origonal conract was signed, in Hune 2013 (Marshall). It is unlikely that Police Scotland will work with Accenture, at least in the near future, due to this issue.
