#Trust#

##Personal Risks##

Trust involves giving up personal control of a situation and involves a great deal of risk between people. We trust people to present correct information but take the risk that that person is telling the truth and presenting true information. If a person gives you inaccurate information, you take the risk of paying for their actions if you pass that information along. This personal trust comes with your perceived reputation of another person, your relationship to that person, and the purpose behind you placing trust in that person. 


##Physical Risks##

Trust also involves an inherent amount of risk between ourselves an the things we interact with and/or surround us. For example, we generally trust an elevator to get us to the 16th floor of a building in a timely matter. It comes naturally to us to trust (or don't trust) the things we can see; such as the objects, environment, and people that surround us. We even seem to easily trust things that we can't see such as the internet and the digital world. We trust the internet in purchasing and ultimately delivering a physical object, such as a ticket to a concert. We also trust our credit cards, which hold our confidential financial information. The integrated chip in credit cards today, helps generate a greater belief that our credit cards keep that financial information safe and protected. 


##Loss of Trust##
Trust can be taken away at a a moments notice, and sometimes without propper cause. Loss of trust is extremely diificult to get back, as a user will always quesion the other party and always have an inkling of distrust. In 2016 Scottish Police canceelled the i6 Project, an integrated IT system worth £46 Million , because of a "loss of trust". The contractor, Accenture, reportedly breached their contract as early as October 2013 and the program was terminated in July of 2016. Accenture was forced to pay back Police Scotland £24.7 Million in refunds and settlements. This lack of trust was caused due to disagreements almost as soon as the origonal conract was signed, in Hune 2013 (Marshall). It is unlikely that Police Scotland will work with Accenture, at least in the near future, due to this issue.

##Building Trust##
For an organization to build a trusting environment, it is recommended that sanctions be placed to maintain said Trust. An example within the Indiana University (IU) community is the implementation of Duo. The byproduct of this implementation is that people feel more comfortable when connecting to IU’s network and dissemination information throughout the network and Pulse Secure. However, these features need to be tinkered with to improve usability and other safeguards must be implemented to further ensure security with sensitive information. 

##Hierarchy of Needs##
Similar to the concept of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, the same pyramid can be used to describe building a trusting relationship. Currently the pyramid can be applied to personal software, sites, and services but not larger business software. The partitions of the pyramid are Baseline, Checking the field, Solidify the choice, Let’s get personal, Dangerously Personal, and LTR. The baseline involves the openness to establish trust. The Checking the field partition involves checking whether the software is relevant to solving the problem. The Solidify the Choice section involves belief that the software can solve one’s problem. The Let’s get Personal section involves the beginning of submitting personal information. The Dangerously Personal section involves more critical personal information like Social Security Numbers and Bank Accounts. Finally, the LTR section involves interest in maintaining the relationship with the software storing one’s personal information. 

##When things go wrong..##
When parts of a system go wrong then the blame is often placed on the software of the system.  But behind all of the software in a system, there are the software engineers who created the software that may be the culprit to problems in the system.  Computers are not able to make decisions on their own so if a computer system has any glitches they are usually caused by making a program incorrectly.  If the program works correctly but the programmer was misinformed, then the blame should go onto the who was in charge of telling the programmer what to create.  Also, blame should not always be placed onto one person.  For example, if a program was made but does not work correctly, all the blame should not be placed on the programmer(s) because the programmer(s) may have not been given enough time to create the program correctly.
