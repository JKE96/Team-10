# Software Development Life Cycles #

## What is an SDLC? ##
The acronym SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle or Systems Development Life Cycle. It is a representation of how a piece of software comes into fruition and how to sustain the software. There is no one correct methodology or process for a SDLC. However, aspects included in most SDLCs are requirements analysis, design, development, quality assurance, and release. 

## Requirements Analysis ##
This aspect involves gathering the specifications, parameters, or necessary features of the system. Basically, this means what will the system have to accomplish, how the system should accomplish these tasks and all the parts involved in completing a task. An understanding of the domain (industry) is needed to specify the requirements for that domain. 

### Steps of Requirement Analysis ###
The three parts of requirements analysis are Eliciting Requirements, Analyzing Requirements, and Recording Requirements.

### How to Gather them ###
Understanding the domain (industry) that the IS will be operating in is crucial to gathering the correct requirements of the IS. Using focus groups, surveys, informal chats, interviews, or observations are potential ways to gather such information. 

### Types of Requirements ###
#### Functional Requirements ####
An aspect of the the Requirements Analysis, the functional requirements are the necessary features collected. Functional Requirements do not specify how a task will be completed, rather it specifies the function, basic details about that function, and why the function is necessary. Each functional requirement is a distinct task that the Information System (IS) must be able to perform. 

#### Non-Functional Requirements ####
Another aspect of Requirements Analysis are the Non-Functional Requirements which explain how the system should perform a task. An example of this would be that the login which is a functional requirement must be done using password encryption which is the Non-Functional part. Non-Functional Requirements are also referred to as technical or operational requirements. 

#### Transitional Requirements ####
The third part of Functional Requirements involves the questions answered to prepare an IS for usage. These questions include who does it, how long it will take, do we need to perform data cleanup first, and how much training is needed.
