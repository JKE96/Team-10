## Everything always changes ##
We live in a world of constant change. Examples of this are changes in life, politics/laws, the physical world, climate, and many more. Within the domain of technology, it is always seen because technology is integrated with every part of life. It effects politics like how most candidates for government positions did not use social media platforms that often while Donald Trump utilized it to reach people throughout his canidacy. Technology is both the cause of change and can experience changes as it evolves. Recent evolution in technology is how people can send and receive payments through services like Chase Quickpay or Venmo. At IU, changes can be seen as the school moved from Oncourse to Canvas, and the software used for scheduling and registration for classes. Essentially, the world is in a constant rate of change.
