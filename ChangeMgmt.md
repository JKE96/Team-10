# Change Management #

## Everything always changes ##
We live in a world of constant change. Examples of this are changes in life, politics/laws, the physical world, climate, and many more. Within the domain of technology, it is always seen because technology is integrated with every part of life. It effects politics like how most candidates for government positions did not use social media platforms that often while Donald Trump utilized it to reach people throughout his canidacy. Technology is both the cause of change and can experience changes as it evolves. Recent evolution in technology is how people can send and receive payments through services like Chase Quickpay or Venmo. At IU, changes can be seen as the school moved from Oncourse to Canvas, and the software used for scheduling and registration for classes. Essentially, the world is in a constant rate of change. 

## Why do things change ##
One common example of change in technology is new and improved hardware. The creation of new hardware is implemented into new processes as seems fit. Examples of this are server architecture, actual computers, peripherals, and "conveyor technology". Another is upgrades in platforms whether it is a programming language, an operating system, or some other type of software. Changing specific tools will be dependent upon on if they can be implemented into the platform. Platforms are always being added, improved, or deprecated and tend not to be the choice of the end user such as in the case of programming languages. For example, Python changed the print function between versions 2 and 3 so users who are accustomed to the Python 2 syntax did not upgrade becasue they did not want syntax they used to be depracated. However, some changes will not be pushed through because of resistence from the eco-system that it is embedded in. Vendors of software or other technology will change software to force people to purchase their new software. The more people rely on the software, the more vendors can implement change without losing users. An example of this is Adobe where many people do not want to change to other media editing software because they are used to how Adobe functions. Best practices are another reason technology changes. An industry or niche within the industry may realize there is a more efficient way of performing some task in which they will implement the change and other organizations within the industry will follow. All change relies on how willing people are to innovate. The less resistence facing a change within an organzation or by people who use the organization's products/services, the more likely a change will be implemented.

## Why do we care?
There are many costs and risks of poorly managed chang. Ignoring or mismanaging the people side of change has real consequences for project performance, such as project delays, budget overruns, required desing rework, resources are not made available, and unexpected obstacles. On an organizational level, poor change management can result in deep and sustained productivity plunges, loss of valued employees, and a reduced quality of work which negatively impacts customers, suppliers, and the morale of the organization itself. Making haphazard changes can be very damaging to the organization, especially if the organization has many stakeholders. That is why risk mitigation and weighing the risks is very important in change management, and making changes to production technologies can have a far-reaching effect on the organization. 

## When do we care?##
There are several conditions under which it is important to manage change. First off, it is important to manage change in risky situations in general, as described in the paragraph above. This becomes especially important when a large amount of people will be effected by a certain change. Errors in the ways a system supports a business process will only become more problematic as the number of users increases, so it is important to be careful when you know that the change is affected a somewhat large population of people. It is also important to manage change when there is money involved. Money is a top priority for businesses and determines how long a business can stay operational for. The last thing we want to lose money is the information system. Finally, it becomes important to manage change when there are multiple stakeholders involved. The IT staff members are not the only stakeholders of an information system change, and there may be many parties that will be intimatley involved in the change. Its important to involve those stakeholders in the change management process and consult where and when it is appropriate.
