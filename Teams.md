* Team members meet and discuss opportunities, challenges, goals
* Orientation of future procedurs
* Discovering roles, strengths, weaknesses of team members
* Processes are in progress

* Developing a clear purpose 
* Tolerance of members is important in this stage, avoid conflict
* members form opinions about character, integrity, etc. of other members

-Stage 3 Norming:
