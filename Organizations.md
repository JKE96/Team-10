# Organizational Theory #
## Systems Theory ##
1. Founded by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy
2. __Principles…__
	* Everything is interrelated
	* Small changes can create a large impact
	* Nonlinear relationships make it difficult to determine cause and effect relationships (complex)
3. __[Systems Dynamics as described by MIT](http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/)__
	* “_The objects and people in a system interact through ‘feedback’ loops, where a change in one variable affects other variables over time, which in term affects the original variable_”
	* attempts to understand the behavior a system can produce
	* makes use of computer models to simulate calculations to represent how the theory can change


## Classical Organization Theory ##
1. Three different types
	* Scientific Management Theory (Taylor)
	* Bureaucratic Theory (Weber)
	* Administrative Theory (Mooney/Reiley)
2. __[Scientific Management] (https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_Taylor.htm)__
	* Four components: 
		- Use the scientific method to find the best ways to complete a task rather than just going through trial and error
		- "_Rather than simply assign workers to just any job, match workers to their jobs based on capability and motivation, and train them to work at maximum efficiency._"
		- Make sure the managers are watching the workers to ensure they are being efficient
		- Allow the managers to plan and train employees, while the employees perform their jobs.
	* Good for simple production of products
	* No regard for worker satisfaction
3. __[Bureaucratic Theory] (http://study.com/academy/lesson/bureaucracy-max-webers-theory-of-impersonal-management.html)__
	* "_A well-defined formal hierarchy and chain of command distinguishes the level of authority within an organization._"
	* Theres is a clear line of authority and division of labor within tasks
4. __[Administrative Theory] (http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006fall/sowo/804/957/Readings/orgtheoryandbehavior.htm)__
	* "_The emphasis was on establishing a universal set of management principles that could be applied to all organizations._"
5. Why Classical Theory Did Not Work...
	* Too many rules and too little worker satisfaction
	* People only worked for the money
