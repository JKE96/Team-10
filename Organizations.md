	* Everything is interrelated
	* Small changes can create a large impact
	* Nonlinear relationships make it difficult to determine cause and effect relationships (complex)
3. __[MIT Systems Dynamics](http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/)__
	* “_The objects and people in a system interact through ‘feedback’ loops, where a change in one variable affects other variables over time, which in term affects the original variable_”
	* attempts to understand the behavior a system can produce
	* makes use of computer models to simulate calculations to represent how the theory can change
