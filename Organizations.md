# Organizational Theory #
## Systems Theory (General Systems Theory) ##
1. Founded by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy
2. __Principles…__
	* Everything is interrelated
	* Small changes can create a large impact
	* Nonlinear relationships make it difficult to determine cause and effect relationships (complex)
3. __[Systems Dynamics as described by MIT](http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/)__
	* “_The objects and people in a system interact through ‘feedback’ loops, where a change in one variable affects other variables over time, which in term affects the original variable_”
	* Attempts to understand the behavior a system can produce
	* Makes use of computer models to simulate calculations to represent how the theory can change
4. __[University of Toronto](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/CSC340F/slides/08-systems.pdf)__
	* Basic Principles…
		* Truth tends to be relative
		* Most views emphasize emphasize each other
	* Defining Systems…
		* What variables are involved in the system
	* How scientists understand the world:
		* Reductionism - breaking a process down into integrated pieces
		* Statistics - measuring the average outcome of a high number of simulations
	* Originally developed for biological models
	* Not necessary to understand all variables in play
	* Understand relationship between different cogs in the system


## Classical Organization Theory ##
1. Three different types
	* Scientific Management Theory (Taylor)
	* Bureaucratic Theory (Weber)
	* Administrative Theory (Mooney/Reiley)
2. __[Scientific Management] (https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_Taylor.htm)__
	* Four components: 
		- Use the scientific method to find the best ways to complete a task rather than just going through trial and error
		- "_Rather than simply assign workers to just any job, match workers to their jobs based on capability and motivation, and train them to work at maximum efficiency._"
		- Make sure the managers are watching the workers to ensure they are being efficient
		- Allow the managers to plan and train employees, while the employees perform their jobs.
	* Good for simple production of products
	* No regard for worker satisfaction
3. __[Bureaucratic Theory] (http://study.com/academy/lesson/bureaucracy-max-webers-theory-of-impersonal-management.html)__
	* "_A well-defined formal hierarchy and chain of command distinguishes the level of authority within an organization._"
	* Theres is a clear line of authority and division of labor within tasks
4. __[Administrative Theory] (http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006fall/sowo/804/957/Readings/orgtheoryandbehavior.htm)__
	* "_The emphasis was on establishing a universal set of management principles that could be applied to all organizations._"
5. Why Classical Theory Did Not Work...
	* Too many rules and too little worker satisfaction
	* People only worked for the money

## Contingency Theory ##
1. Proposed by Fred E. Fiedler in 1964: [Contingency Model](http://www.toolshero.com/leadership/fiedler-contingency-model/)
	- "Relationship (contingency) between the effectiveness of the leadership 	    style and the situation."
	- Fiedler distinguished three factors: (1) Make up of the group, (2) Nature of  	    the task, and (3) Power of the leader 
2. [Principles](http://kannanpersonal.com/learning/management/contingency2.html):
	- "Contingency theory firmly understands the fact that our social and 	    business environment is always subject to change" 
	- Conflict Previously avoided, but inherently unavoidable
	- No best way to organize a corporation, make decisions, or lead an 	    organization 
	- The “best way” depends/is contingent on  the situation at hand
	- leader's effectiveness determined by interaction of leader's style of 	   behavior and favorableness of the situational characteristics.
3. Different Approaches: 
	- Jay Lorsch and Paul Lawrence(1967): Interested in impact of factors of 	   contingency on organizational structure and ManagerialAuthority.
	- Alfred Chandler (1962): argued that organizational strategy be proposed 	   before establishing structure. Idea that organizations adapt logically.
