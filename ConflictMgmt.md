## What is Conflict ##
Conflict is described as a struggle or friction between two or more parties. They can be caused by diverting ideas, suggestions, courses of action, job performance, interests and or values. Conflicts are synonymous with disagreements. 

## Where does Conflict come from ##
Bell and Hart came up with eight different causes of workplace conflict in the early 2000s. These are defined as needs, styles, perceptions, goals, pressures, roles, values, and policies. 

### Conflicting Needs ###
Conflicting needs stem from resources which by nature are limited. These resources can be physical, monetary, and time. 

### Conflicting Styles ###
Conflicting styles stem from people doing things in their own ways. People tend to disagree about the proper style to perform some task or activity. Examples of this are programming/development and requirements analysis. 

### Conflicting Perceptions ###
By viewing the the same incidents differently, conflict can stem. An an example of this would be hiring an extra developer where another developer at the company could view this as another helping hand or that he/she is not doing enough. 

### Conflict Goals ###
Conflict can stem from people who have different goals. Examples of goals are increasing performance metrics, the scope of the project, or departmental duties. 

### Conflicting Pressures ### 
Another way that conflict stems is deadlines because different people are responsible for different things and their deadlines may overlap. This is especially relevant when a firm is dealing with multiple clients. 

### Conflicting Roles ###
Jobs roles tend to focus on a specific set of duties dependent upon the role. Two ways that conflict can manifest from required functions that are not specifically defined duties of that role or two people who have the same role. When people have the same roles, it can lead to one person trying to do more work to feel more relevant. 

### Different Personal Values ###
Cliques can be formed in the workplace because of differing values. Such cliques can promote gossip and rumors. It is important to maintain diversity and to practice empathy so that cliques do not form. 

### Unpredictable Policies ###
Misunderstandings are another key driver of conflict in the workplace. Policies must be clear and concise as to not cause misunderstandings. Not having clear and concise policies creates uncertainty. These uncertainties can lead to different perceptions and interpretations. 

##Offensive Strategies##

It is important, and far easier to be in an offensive position in a group conflict, rather than a defensive position when working to manage that conflict. It is well worth one's time to be actively mitigating a conflict rather waiting for the pot to boil over, as long as they are putting in the extra effort to maintain sanity and deal with the issue(s) as a professional should. By actively engaging in working to fix a conflict, you are also making others involved aware that there is a conflict that poses a risk and that you think is important enough to find a solution to. This may help generate active, offensive contribution from other members of a team, making it easier to tackle a conflict. An offensive strategy, especially when working with multiple clients or stakeholders, is to keep everyone updated, and to share the progress of a specific task to all those involved. Even if nothing is done, its important that those involved know that working on the task is still a priority to you. Another strategy is to establish clear deliverables, owners, and due dates, so that everyone involved is aware of what they are responsible for, otherwise conflict could be sparked if responsibilties are not clear. Next, it is very important to always test the system, and test it  hard. The more comprehensive the testing is, the better off the information system will be. Finding issues with a system not only leads to conflict between the user and the system, but can also cause conflict between the systems team. Finally, it is essential that you be forward in any conflict. Since conflicts aren't going to always solve themselves, it is beneficial that you actively engage in searching for a solution or else you face the risk of the conflict growing.
