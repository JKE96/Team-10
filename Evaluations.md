## Defining Evaluation ##
Evaluation is considered a “systematic process of determining merit, value, or worth”. Essentially it is judgement with the goal of being objective. It is important because it helps people to quantify and explain success and failure. If a firm is unable to understand why it is failing it will never succeed and if it cannot determine why it is successful, it will have difficulty maintaining such success. The evaluation focuses on the past, present, and future demonstrating the progression and/or evolution of an organization as a whole or a specific product or service that they provide. According to Project Muse, evaluation research is complicated to define because not all people have a common agreement about what it is. It is considered to be an applied or action research and not the type of research that is theoretical. Some of the reasons enumerated by the article for implementing evaluation research are to account for how people use their limited resources, describe the effects of certain actions, and to express concern to the public because of improper handling of information.
