	The results of a quantitative evaluation are those in which can be explicitly measured, calculated, or counted, and those results remain constant for everyone who is observing them. Quantitative evaluations serve to answer questions such as "How many?", "How much did it cost?", "What were the outcomes?", etc. Quantitative data can be collected by close-ended surveys or questionnaires, tests, observations, cost-benefit analysis, or review of existing documents and databases(Data points/mining. Methods such as close-ended surveys can be translated into numeric data that can be counted/calculated.  Data mining, the most modern method of IS data collection, can gather intel of user and environment activity by looking at how exactly users interact with their information system, and data based on their usage, preferences, and user effectiveness can be exposed.
