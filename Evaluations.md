#Quantitative Evaluation#

	The results of a quantitative evaluation are those in which can be explicitly measured, calculated, or counted, and those results remain constant for everyone who is observing them. Quantitative evaluations serve to answer questions such as "How many?", "How much did it cost?", "What were the outcomes?", etc. Quantitative data can be collected by close-ended surveys or questionnaires, tests, observations, cost-benefit analysis, or review of existing documents and databases(Data points/mining. Methods such as close-ended surveys can be translated into numeric data that can be counted/calculated.  Data mining, the most modern method of IS data collection, can gather intel of user and environment activity by looking at how exactly users interact with their information system, and data based on their usage, preferences, and user effectiveness can be exposed.

# Evaluation #
## Defining Evaluation ##
Evaluation is considered a “systematic process of determining merit, value, or worth”. Essentially it is judgement with the goal of being objective. It is important because it helps people to quantify and explain success and failure. If a firm is unable to understand why it is failing it will never succeed and if it cannot determine why it is successful, it will have difficulty maintaining such success. The evaluation focuses on the past, present, and future demonstrating the progression and/or evolution of an organization as a whole or a specific product or service that they provide. According to Project Muse, evaluation research is complicated to define because not all people have a common agreement about what it is. It is considered to be an applied or action research and not the type of research that is theoretical. Some of the reasons enumerated by the article for implementing evaluation research are to account for how people use their limited resources, describe the effects of certain actions, and to express concern to the public because of improper handling of information.
